    <p1>Everyone has to provide themselves and/or family members the adequate amount of necessities to live. The necessities people provide themself with creates lifestyle. The truth behind many of the products that these people buy is damaging to both consumers and the environment. The companies of these products are sneaky; they use extremely harsh and dangerous chemicals, disregarding all health-related consequences that come with the use of these products. As much as 300 million tons of plastic waste is created in the U.S. alone, and 40% of the plastic is used for packaging once, then thrown out. All this shopping leads to an immense amount of waste that profoundly impacts the environment.</p1>
